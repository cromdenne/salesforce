Wisconsin winters are unforgiving. When wind chill factors plunge the
temperature into the negative teens it’s not long before the imagination
drifts to warmer weather.<!-- end_excerpt --> In early 2016 these conditions 
led me into a corner of the Internet that revealed a very interesting topic: 
travel hacking.

At this point I’d spent two years happily swimming in the deep end of personal
finance obsession, so the concept of using credit cards strategically to
accumulate rewards for free vacations was intriguing. But before diving in I’d
need to understand the details.

This is the story of how Taylor and I planned and carried out our first travel
hack, a five-night vacation to San Francisco for only $1,200 including food and
activities.

#### Fighting Skepticism
When I read that we could fly just about anywhere in the world and stay in
excellent hotels all for free, my reaction was naturally that it’s too good to
be true. Someone must have something to gain in this process, and it can’t be
anything more than a scam. How could credit card companies really afford to
give away such lucrative rewards? How could booking this stuff be simple enough
for a normal person to figure out? Are we going to go through with this and get
to the airport only to find out that our “special rewards” tickets are no good?

It seemed like a lot of people had done this successfully, so it couldn’t all
be fiction, could it? I had to understand the incentives at play here before
I could trust that this really works.

Credit card companies offering rewards for signing up isn’t a new concept.
Your bank probably has a similar cash reward for opening a checking account.
Retailers do this too — Barnes & Noble offers discount coupons when you sign
up for a membership, and Target offers a discount for each transaction if you
sign up for their REDcard program. These organizations and companies are
looking for loyalty — when you sign up with them [you’ll probably end up being
a repeat customer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanpearson/2016/06/24/the-psychology-behind-fee-based-credit-cards-3-tips-for-retailers/#63fc79403cf9){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"} and spending more money with them.

  <div class="caption">
    <p>If you shop on Amazon you've probably seen a deal like this advertised.
    Many businesses offer some kind of incentive for signing up with their 
    credit card or rewards program.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

Credit card companies have the same incentives — when you sign up for their
card, you become a customer likely to generate money for them by paying
interest and fees. These two streams of revenue are pretty significant, but
even if you’re a careful customer who diligently avoids interest and fees,
the credit card companies are still making money in a third way: interchange
fees with every transaction. Don’t worry, [these companies are making
bread](https://www.fool.com/credit-cards/2017/04/13/this-is-how-credit-card-companies-hauled-in-163-bi.aspx){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"} even if you’re 
using credit for “free”.

So the incentives line up for the credit card companies, and they form
partnerships with travel companies who have similar incentives. This all made
sense to me, but could travel hacking really be so easy? Just sign up for a
credit card and reap the rewards? What about dealing with all those points?
And aren’t there restrictions? What about my credit score — am I going to mess 
it up by applying for and using a couple of credit cards?

After reading about several great trips planned using rewards, I figured the
downside was limited. Taylor and I wanted to open a joint credit card after
getting married anyway so that we could continue to build our credit. We
could pick one good rewards card and just see how it worked. We’d meet the
bonus requirements and then we’d find out how easy or difficult it was to
plan a trip. If it didn’t work out we wouldn’t have lost anything — we’d be
paying off the card in full every month so as not to accrue any interest or
fees. One credit pull wouldn’t hurt our credit scores, and a habit of on-time
payments would make us reliable borrowers in the future.
<br>
<br>
#### Choosing Our Card and Meeting the Bonus Requirements
After doing much research, the consensus opinion online was that Chase
offered the best rewards with their cards. This was because they had several
cards with valuable bonuses and their points were flexible since they had
many travel partners. For example, their Sapphire Preferred card offered
50,000 points, and those points would translate to roughly $625 in travel
rewards. Their airline partners included United and Southwest, and they also
partnered with Hyatt for hotel stays. These all seemed like great options for
whatever trip we’d eventually try to plan, so near the end of 2016 we decided
to apply for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card.

This card did require a pretty solid credit score to qualify since it offered
such valuable rewards. Although both of us had great credit scores, Taylor’s
history was a bit longer since she had opened a couple other low-stakes cards
in the past to build credit. So she applied for the card online, and she was
approved almost immediately. That was easy!

Our first step after qualifying for the card was to add me as an authorized
user since Taylor was the primary cardholder. This was pretty easy and we
completed it online. By adding an authorized user we automatically earned
5,000 bonus points. <span class="badge badge-gold">1</span> Score!

<div class="note">
  <div class="row label">1<span class="vertical-rule"></span></div>
  <div class="row text">
    Note that if we were doing this today, we would NOT have added me as an
    authorized user. With a little experience we’ve learned that having just one
    person on each card is best for rewards. This is because of the rules for
    each card. Typically you can earn another sign up bonus on the same card two
    or four years after the first time you earn that bonus. That means two years
    after Taylor opened this card, she could close this account and apply for the
    card again, and then get the bonus again. The same rules apply to me as an
    authorized user. However, if I hadn’t been an authorized user on the card, I
    could have opened my own card and earned the same bonus whenever I wanted to.
    So that’s a missed opportunity for now.
  </div><!-- /.row -->
</div><!-- /.note -->

The next step would be planning our spending so that we got those 50,000
bonus points! Most rewards cards work this way — you open the card, and then
you need to meet a “minimum spending requirement” within the first 1–4
months. <span class="badge badge-gold">2</span> As soon as you hit the minimum spend the bonus is deposited into your
account.

<div class="note">
  <div class="row label">2<span class="vertical-rule"></span></div>
  <div class="row text">
    Before I dive into minimum spending, this is where I should say that credit
    card rewards are only worth the effort if you’re responsible with the card.
    This means paying no interest or fees other than possibly an annual renewal
    fee depending on the card. If your bonus is worth $625, but you’re racking up
    hundreds of dollars in interest, then you’re not really coming out ahead.
    Only do this if you can responsibly pay off your card so that you’re carrying
    a $0 balance every month.
  </div><!-- /.row -->
</div><!-- /.note -->

For the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, the minimum spending requirement was
$4,000 in the first three months. This may sound like a lot, but with some
planning it actually wasn’t too difficult. We needed about $1,400 per month
to go on the card, so we used it for all of our monthly spending. That meant
heat and electricity bills, internet and television bills, the cell phone
bill, gas, groceries, and any other spending. This stuff would normally come
out of our checking accounts, so instead we’d put it on the credit card and
then just pay off the card with our checking accounts as soon as the
transactions were posted.

We hit the target with our normal spending, but we had plans if we were going
to fall short. We weren’t going to buy things we wouldn’t have normally
bought just to meet the requirement, but there are other ways to “work the
system”. For example, if you shop for groceries at Costco like we do, you
could buy yourself a $500 or $1,000 gift card. That counts as spending on the
credit card today in order to meet the minimum spending requirement, but in
the future when you go grocery shopping you’ll just use the gift card and
your budget will take no hit. You could also pre-pay other bills. We use
Geico for our auto insurance, and they have an option to pay your premium for
six months at once instead of every month. I think you actually get a
slightly better rate this way as well, so you could just time your insurance
payments with your credit card minimum spending time frame. The six-month
premium for us is around $450, so that’s a good chunk that could go toward
the minimum spending requirement today and then we don’t have to worry about
that bill for six months!

After we met the minimum spending requirement  in month three, the 50,000
bonus points were deposited into our account with that month’s billing
statement, which was of course $0 since we always paid our balance.

At this point we had the initial 5,000 bonus points from adding me as an
authorized user, plus the 50,000 bonus points for meeting the minimum
spending requirement. Using the card also earns you one point per dollar
spent (with extra points for certain types of spending each month). So with our
bonuses and our normal spending, we were right around 60,000 points already
at the end of month three, which could translate to about $725 in travel
rewards.

But how did that $725 or 60,000 points work? Would we just redeem it for
cash, or transfer it to other rewards programs somehow?
<br>
<br>
#### Planning Our Points
Now that we had a healthy chunk of points, I logged into our Chase account
and visited the “Ultimate Rewards” area. This is the Chase travel portal
where you can manage all of your rewards.

Here we could see all of the options to earn extra points in certain
categories, we could redeem our points for “cash back”, we could book travel
through Chase using our points, or we could transfer our points to Chase’s
travel partners. During my research I had read that transferring points was
often the best deal, and cashing out was often the worst. If we were to
redeem our points for straight-up cash, we’d get $0.01 for each point. That
would mean $600 for our 60,000 points — not bad for a couple months of
minimum effort.

But then I looked up the [Hyatt rewards
table](https://world.hyatt.com/content/gp/en/rewards/free-nights-upgrades.html){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}. There were seven categories of Hyatts, 
ranging from fancy (the category one Hyatt Regency Green Bay, where Taylor and 
I had our wedding reception) to super luxurious (the category seven Park 
Hyatt Sydney in Australia, a world-renowned five-star hotel). A category one 
Hyatt was just 5,000 points for a free night, and a category seven was 30,000.

<div class="caption-img">
  <img class="img-fluid lazy"
       src="/images/placeholder.png"
       data-src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10mULH4okA5lMh4jOK-VX7riQ3b0LQ-PF"
       alt="Hyatt all-inclusive resorts rewards table">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>In addition to the categories I mentioned above, Hyatt also has several
    all-inclusive resorts that accept rewards points!</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

Our 60,000 points had some context now, and two nights at one of the fanciest
hotels in the world seemed intuitively more valuable than $600 cash. The math
worked out too: our 60,000 points would get us two nights at the Park Hyatt
Sydney, which would normally cost around $2,000. That meant that our points
would be worth a little over $0.03 each, which was three times the value of
straight-up cash!

So all math aside, it was clear that the Hyatt redemption was a pretty good
deal. A quick look at the United website showed me that 50,000 points would
get both Taylor and I free round-trip flights to just about anywhere in the
United States, so the flight deals were promising too.

Our next step would be to look at destinations to see how many points we’d
need to plan a trip. We eventually settled on the Bay Area. Taylor really
wanted to visit Alcatraz, I wanted to explore the redwoods, and San Francisco
seemed like an excellent first destination for us.

A quick search revealed that there were five Hyatts in the Bay Area that
would work for our trip. Two were in category three (12,000 points per night), 
one was in category four (15,000 points per night), and two were in category
five (20,000 points per night).

We probably weren’t going to stay in one of the super-fancy category five
hotels for our first trip, so depending which of the others we chose we’d
need 60,000–75,000 points for a five-night trip. We’d also need 50,000 points
for the flights. So we were going to need to stockpile around 110,000–125,000
points for our full trip if we wanted to have free flights and lodging.

Not too bad — we were about halfway there already after just three months.
It was March 2017 at this point, and for now we’d just keep chugging along,
putting all of our spending on the credit card and paying it off every month to 
avoid interest.
<br>
<br>
#### Booking the Trip
Toward the end of 2017 we decided that we’d plan our trip for sometime in
January–April of 2018. We wanted to get away from the bitter cold of our
Wisconsin weather! We’d stashed away quite a few points by now, and we’d also 
discovered some extra points in Taylor’s Hyatt rewards account from our wedding 
reception.

In January 2018 we had amassed around 120,000 points between our credit card 
spending and the Hyatt rewards, so we finally decided to book our trip.

The first step would be putting together an itinerary. We needed to have an
idea of the places we wanted to visit and the activities we wanted to
experience before deciding which hotel to go with and whether a certain time 
frame would work best. We did save most of our vacation time at work up to this 
point in the year, so we were able to be flexible with our trip rather than 
being confined to flying out on a Friday and returning the following weekend.

After we put together a list of things we wanted to do in California, we
settled on staying at the [Hyatt Centric Fisherman’s Wharf San
Francisco](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/california/hyatt-centric-fishermans-wharf-san-francisco/sfofw){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}, a category three 
hotel that cost 15,000 points per night. I didn’t book anything yet though — I 
wanted to have everything laid out and planned before moving any points around.

I searched for flights next. We preferred to fly out of our own city and
Southwest didn’t service Green Bay, so I started by looking through flights
with United. [The United rewards
chart](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/apps/mileageplus/awards/travel/awardTravel.aspx){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"} showed that flights from the midwest 
to the west coast would be 12,500 points per person one way, or 50,000 points 
total for Taylor and I round-trip.

Using United’s search features turned out to be pretty easy. You don’t need
to be a member to check flight costs in miles instead of cash, and United
has a handy feature to search many dates at once (just check the box saying
your dates are flexible). I plugged in our departure and arrival airports and a 
flexible date, and then looked through the results for flights that cost the 
fewest points. The results were shown per person and I had selected round-trip 
flights, so I was looking for trips that showed me a cost of 25,000 points.

Flying with rewards isn’t quite as flexible as flying with cash, but I was
surprised that there were quite a few dates that would work for us. And even if 
we had a rigid schedule to stick to, we could have just spent more points to 
find the right flights for us.

After finding flights that worked well for us I wrote up one final itinerary 
including details for our departures and arrivals, the hotels we’d be staying 
in, rough schedules for the activities/sights we wanted to get to on our trip, 
and the cost of it all in rewards points. We were finally ready to book our 
trip!
<br>
<br>
#### Transferring Points and Making Reservations
First I wanted to reserve our hotel room with Hyatt. In order to use points
with Hyatt you have to create a free World of Hyatt account, but we were able 
to skip this step since Taylor already had an account from our wedding
reception. I logged into the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal from our credit card 
and selected Hyatt as a travel partner to transfer points. I had to enter the 
information for our Hyatt account, and then I was able to choose how many 
points to transfer from our Chase account into our Hyatt account (in increments 
of 1,000).

The points are supposed to show up in the Hyatt account immediately after a
transfer, but the first time I tried this transfer something went wrong. Our 
points didn’t show up in the Hyatt account after a few days, so I finally 
contacted Chase to see what was going on. They noticed the issue and reversed 
the transfer so that I could try again. It seems like this was just a fluke, as 
the second time I did the transfer the points were indeed deposited into our 
Hyatt account immediately.

At this point we could have booked our hotel stay online at Hyatt’s website, 
but I wanted to be sure that everything worked out so I called our hotel 
instead. Making the reservation was painless and took only a few minutes even 
though we were using rewards.

After receiving confirmation that our hotel was booked I moved on to our
flights. I had to create a free United MileagePlus account in order to transfer 
our points from Chase, so I did that before logging back into our Chase 
account. I initiated a transfer and was relieved to see that our points were 
again immediately deposited. From there I searched for the flights that I had 
found a couple days before and carried out the purchase using our points. There 
was still a small fee of roughly $25 that applies to all flights even if you’re 
using rewards, but everything worked and the bulk of our trip was taken care of!
<br>
<br>
#### The Savings
We had a wonderful time in California and everything worked out just as 
planned. There were no unexpected surprises as a result of using our points, 
and we were even able to take advantage of a deal the hotel was running to earn 
extra points during our stay!

If we had booked our five nights at the Hyatt Centric Fisherman's Wharf with 
cash it would have cost us at least $1,200. Instead we were able to use 67,500 
points and just $100 to book our stay. (We were a couple thousand points short 
for booking everything, so we decided to use the option of paying for one of 
our nights with points and cash.)

If we had booked our flights with cash they would have cost at least $825. So 
we saved at least $2,000 by using rewards in our first attempt! This was a 
great return for opening a credit card and putting our normal spending on it 
for a year, and the process was surprisingly simple.

  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

Without having to worry about paying for our hotel and flights, we were able to 
take this entire trip for just $1,250. That included all of our meals, a [fancy 
tour of
Alcatraz](https://www.alcatrazcruises.com/tour-options/behind-the-scenes-tour/){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}, a day hiking through the redwoods at John 
Muir National Monument, and much more.
<br>
<br>
#### The Verdict
Travel hacking feels like it’s too good to be true, but after one successful 
trip I can say that it works incredibly well for only a modest amount of 
effort. Since our first trip was such a success we’ve already been planning 
another. We’ve opened up a couple new credit cards for more rewards, and our 
next trip will be to Hawaii. We think we’ll be able to pull off a luxurious 
eight night trip for less than $2,000 total, so I’ll provide an update when 
we’ve conquered this next challenge!

If you have any questions about our trip, or if you’re thinking about diving 
into travel hacking for yourself, feel free to reach out. We’d be happy to 
share our experience and talk you through your own first hack!
