Here I am.

And here you are. It seems you've found my little corner of the Internet. Maybe
you're a friend who uncovered this blog, or maybe you're a stranger who
stumbled upon a snippet of code.<!-- end_excerpt --> In any case, welcome. 
This blog is mainly meant as an outlet for my own creative journey, but if you 
find something valuable along the way that's great too.

A warning: I don't plan on carving out a singular theme here. Maybe someday
I'll spin off a separate blog dedicated to a topic I'm particularly tuned
into, but this space will mostly be a wide-ranging representation of stuff I'm 
making or experiences I'm accruing. There will be posts on coding and 
development, travel and travel hacking, photography, personal finance, coaching 
and soccer, and whatever else I dive into. I certainly won't be an expert voice 
on any of these topics, but maybe the mistakes and experiences I write about 
will help you along your journey too.

So again, welcome. Dip your toes in, absorb what interests you and leave the
rest. I'll see you around.
