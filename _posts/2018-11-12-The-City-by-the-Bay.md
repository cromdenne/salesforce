It was the biggest, baddest Wisconsin blizzard of my lifetime... and we spent it
in San Francisco.

We were certainly happy to trade the April snow for the mild weather of the 
Bay Area!<!-- end_excerpt --> This was going to be the longest and farthest 
trip for Taylor and I since our honeymoon in St. Lucia, and we had planned it 
out a couple months in advance with some travel hacking strategies ([details 
are in this
post](https://blog.romdenne.com/2019/01/10/Travel-Hacking/){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}).

The trip was excellent and we were disappointed to have to leave the beautiful
weather, especially considering what we returned to.
<br>
<br>

<br>
#### Day 1
Our trip began early Wednesday morning with a flight out of Green Bay at
6:00AM. We had booked our tickets on United Airlines because of the rewards
points we'd accumulated, and this was our first experience with United.
Everything went smoothly, and we arrived in San Francisco around noon local
time after a connection in Chicago. I certainly appreciated the relative calm
of all three airports for early-morning midweek flights, and I think we'll try
to plan future trips on a similar schedule.

After finding a shuttle from SFO to our hotel near Fisherman's Wharf
([SuperShuttle](https://www.supershuttle.com/){:
.underline-effect}{:target="blank"} turned out to be the easiest option with a
reasonable price, we'd consider using them again), we had a relaxed afternoon 
to explore our surroundings. Our first destination was Pier 39.

       alt="Fisherman's Wharf sea lions">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>One of our first stops was to visit the sea lions. Taylor got hooked and
    we ended up checking in on them each day!</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

After grabbing some food at one of the many restaurants, we explored a few
shops and wandered to the end of the pier with the sea lions. They're
interesting creatures, and Taylor loved watching them flop around looking for
prime napping real estate and playfully fighting each other.

After we'd had enough of the sea lions' shenanigans for one afternoon we
explored a bit more and eventually made our way to Ghirardelli Square. I'm a
sucker for good ice cream, so this wasn't our last trip to the hallowed
chocolate company. We came home with a lot of treats after we discovered
later in the week that we could get a ton of free samples by walking through 
each of the four shop areas within 10 minutes...

We wrapped up our first day with a bit more sightseeing around the area and
then headed back to the hotel to relax and plan our trip to Muir Woods
National Monument the next morning.

<br>
#### Day 2
Our alarms were set for 6:00AM, but the time difference helped this late
riser wake up rested and ready on Thursday.

The day began with an early trip to the nearest Enterprise for a rental car. 
This was our first experience renting a vehicle, and we had reserved an 
"Economy" option via the Enterprise app the night before. Checking in and 
getting the car was a quick process, and we even got a free upgrade because it 
was just easier for the representative to get another option out of the 
parking area!

After about 20 minutes at Enterprise we were on the road and making our way 
across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito. Driving over the bridge for the
first time was a special experience â€” this architectural monument was as
impressive in person as it is in the multitude of stunning images we saw.
Including our return trip that day we made three more trips across the bridge 
during our week in San Francisco, although visiting Battery Spencer for photos
of the breathtaking view would wait until our final day.

From the bridge we intended to go straight to Muir Woods National Monument, but
we missed our turn onto Panoramic Highway. Since it was still early and we had
our whole day in front of us, we decided to continue on Shoreline Highway as we
knew it would take us closer to the ocean. Our mistake took us to the Muir 
Beach Overlook, and by the time we got there we were very glad to have stumbled 
upon this detour!

It was around 8:15AM when we pulled into the parking lot at the small picnic
area. We were just the second to arrive, the first being a relaxed Great Blue 
Huron near one of the park benches. We checked out the neat 3D map of the area 
and the four historic concrete military structures before heading down the
narrow winding path to the overlook.

       alt="ocean view from Muir Beach Overlook">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>The views at Muir Beach Overlook were incredible, and since we got there
    early we had the park to ourselves. Visiting this serene area was a perfect
    start to our morning!</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->


After taking in the spectacular views of the beach and ocean we made our way 
back to the parking area and set a route for our original destination.

We arrived to a relatively quiet park entrance at 9:00AM. We had purchased our
[reservation online](https://gomuirwoods.com/){:
.underline-effect}{:target="blank"} the night before since passes were not 
available at the visitor center, and this made parking fairly simple. Within 
minutes we were parked and had made our way to the visitor center to check out 
maps and souvenirs. 

Our decision to visit the forest in the morning on a weekday proved to be a
good one. We had read that the area can feel more like an amusement park than a
natural wonder at peak times, but on this Thursday morning we only saw about 50
other guests until returning to the park entrance in the afternoon.

The first thing that struck me was the sheer size and number of the Redwoods.
This is perhaps to be expected, but the next thing that caught my eye was the
way the light played off of the creek and the growth between the trees. There 
was no fog on our visit, but the day was beautiful and the sunlight patches 
really gave depth and vibrance to the forest.

       alt="light playing tricks on Redwoods">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>But the way the sunlight peeks through and highlights the brilliant 
    colors of the forest is also impressive.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

After meandering along the boardwalk paths and finding the interesting United 
Nations Memorial and the tranquil "Cathedral Grove", we finally came to a fork
in the road where our hike for the day would truly begin. We had decided the
night before that we would take the Ben Johnson to Dipsea Trail loop back to
the park entrance. As first-time hikers we didn't quite know what we were
getting ourselves into, but the mildly challenging 4-mile, 2-hour journey
offered some great memories.

The hike began with a steep ascent and a few narrow log bridges. We were a bit 
apprehensive along the way, particularly when the path showed signs of a recent 
mudslide, but we persevered and took frequent water breaks. We found an 
awesome Redwood with a picture-perfect split, as well as an impressive fallen 
giant, before finally reaching the peak of our route over 1,000 feet higher 
than where we set out.

  <div class="caption">
    <p>We had to pause and test the footing when we arrived at this part of the

    a fairly steep drop to the side (left of the frame in the photo).</p>

       alt="base of large fallen Redwood">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>After finally reaching the highest point in our hike we took a short 
    water break and admired the scenery.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

Shortly after we began our descent the forest broke and we joined up with the
Deer Park Fire Road for a more leisurely walk with outstanding views of the
valley and ocean beyond. The gradual downhill trek was much easier than the 
first leg of our trip, but the dirt road was very dry and had many deep veins
created by erosion. The trail must have been a popular mountain biking route 
as we met a few cyclists admirably fighting the relentless uphill climb in the
opposite direction.

<div class="caption-img">
  <img class="img-fluid lazy"
       src="/images/placeholder.png"
       data-src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/889/41665635644_305d463f56_b.jpg"
       alt="vista from the Dipsea Trail">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>Our long hike was a great experience and led us to a few incredible
    views, including this one from the Dipsea Trail.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

As we continued we found that the last stretch of the Dipsea Trail back to the 
park entrance was closed due to recent mudslides, so we took a slight detour to 
Franks Valley Road and followed it back to the parking lot. It was now slightly
past 1:00PM and the area was much busier than when we'd arrived a few hours 
earlier.

We made another visit to the gift shop for a couple souvenirs, and then we
plotted a course to Tiburon for lunch.

We wanted to settle in near the bay for a relaxing lunch, so we chose a Mexican
restaurant named Guaymas with a great view of Angel Island. The food was
delicious and we took time to relax after our grueling morning. After we'd 
had our fill we headed outside to take in the outstanding view across the bay 
from Shoreline Park before finally returning to Fisherman's Wharf for the day.

  <div class="caption">
    <p>Shoreline Park offered great views of Angel Island and the bay, but the
    park itself was also picturesque.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

On our way back we intended to make a stop at one of the many scenic overlooks
in the Marin Headlands, but they were fairly busy and we couldn't find a
parking spot so we decided we'd make our way back on the last morning of our 
trip.

We drove back over the bridge and dropped off the rental car before walking
back to our hotel around 4:00PM to spend some time relaxing after a long day.
We couldn't miss out on the sea lions though, so we made a brief trip to Pier
39 to walk through the shops and admire the silly creatures again.

This was one of the busiest days of our trip, so we wrapped up Thursday early
with some rest at the hotel, thankful we'd planned to sleep in on Friday.

<br>
#### Day 3
Friday (the 13th!) was our Alcatraz day, but since our excursion wasn't until
5:00PM we had plenty of time to explore more of Fisherman's Wharf at our
leisure. We began our day at Pier 45 with a tour of the [S.S. Jeremiah
O'Brien](https://www.ssjeremiahobrien.org/){: .underline-effect}{:
target="blank"}.

<div class="caption-img">
  <img class="img-fluid lazy"

       alt="view to door looking to Alcatraz on S.S. Jeremiah O'Brien">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>Exploring the inside of the ship gave us an appreciation for the life of
    American sailors during World War II.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

The self-guided tour through the "living museum" provided an interesting walk 
through the nautical history of World War II. There were a couple large
dioramas that painted a vivid picture of the Normandy beaches during the D-Day
Invasion, which was the most notable voyage in the ship's history.

Following our tour we ventured to Anchorage Square for our first experience at 
In-N-Out Burger. There was a pretty big lunch rush, but we eventually headed 
out to the courtyard with our food. The burger was good, but certainly didn't 
match up to a Culver's ButterBurger!

After our lunch we stopped back at the hotel to change and prepare for the main
attraction of our day â€” Alcatraz. We eventually made our way out to Pier 39 for
more exploring and an early dinner/snack at the The CrÃªpe CafÃ© before
journeying farther down the Embarcadero to Pier 33 and the dock for our ferry.

<div class="caption-img">

  <div class="caption">

    discernable from the piers of Fisherman's Wharf, but it becomes more
    impressive the closer you get.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

We boarded the ferry at 5:00PM and after a brief scenic trip to the island our 
tour began.

Since Taylor was so excited about this part of the trip we had purchased 
tickets for an additional "Behind the Scenes" tour of the island, and one of 
the first parts of the tour was to venture through the guardhouse, past the 
power house and through the tunnels to the northwest edge of the island. Our 
tour guide told us about the Model Industries Building and escape attempts as 
we explored outdoor areas under the San Francisco sunset.

<div class="caption-img">
  <img class="img-fluid lazy"
       src="/images/placeholder.png"
       data-src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1760/42340150952_a033336f25_b.jpg"
       alt="Alcatraz underground holding area">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>The tunnels led us to this underground holding area, which was pretty
    colorful thanks to the decades of accumulated rust.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

After exploring the lower edge of the island the guide led us uphill past the
apartment building to the garden below the water tower. We learned how the
island was occupied in protest for 19 months by Native Americans, which is why
the sign at the park entrance and the water tower are painted with references
to Indians. The tour guide also told us how the island was originally a 
military prison before becoming famous for holding federal prisoners.

From the water tower we finally made it into the main cellhouse. We were shown
each cell block (including the famous Broadway) before making our way into the
underground dungeon area used for solitary confinement. It was obvious why the
dark, bare cells there were reserved for the worst-behaved prisoners.

<div class="caption-img">
  <img class="img-fluid lazy"
       src="/images/placeholder.png"

       alt="Broadway cell block at Alcatraz">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>Broadway was impressive, and it was striking just how confined the
    prisoners were in their cells. This cellhouse is also where we saw the
    tunnel made by prisoners during the famous 1962 escape.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->


Our last stop behind the scenes was the the shower room. Here the park ranger
accompanying our tour told us about the history of violence and danger in 
prisons, even showing us examples of shivs taken from various prisoners! After
wrapping up the "Behind the Scenes" tour here we grabbed a set of headphones 
for the self-guided cellhouse audio tour.

This interesting tour led us through the cellhouse and surrounding areas while
we listened to former prisoners and prison officials about life at Alcatraz. We
walked through the recreation yard and the outdoor area near the lighthouse, 
which provided an incredible view of the San Francisco skyline at dusk. 

<div class="caption-img">

       alt="view of sunset over the Golden Gate Bridge from Alcatraz rec yard">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>We were able to explore many of the outdoor areas during sunset, and the
    recreation yard in particular provided some excellent views of the Golden 
    Gate Bridge.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

After finishing the audio portion of the tour we exited the main prison 
building through the gift shop into the dark night. As we made our way back 
down to the ferry docks we took in the spectacular view of the illuminated Bay 
Bridge.

We finally boarded the boat and roughly an hour later at 10:30PM we were back
at the hotel. Even though this was a lighter day we still felt we'd seen and
explored so much, and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Alcatraz!

<br>
#### Day 4
Because the night before was a late one with our return from Alcatraz, we had a
relatively lazy morning on Saturday. After getting brunch and researching the
public transit system, we decided to catch an Uber out to Golden Gate Park for
a leisurely stroll through the many interesting areas within.

<div class="caption-img">
  <img class="img-fluid lazy"
       src="/images/placeholder.png"
       data-src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lCxT88wYei4DcIcmVNyjVCr9NZotQ0bL"
       alt="San Francisco cable car">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>We considered public transit and checked out one of the cable car
    turntables, but we decided Uber would just be easier to get us out to
    Golden Gate Park from our hotel near Fisherman's Wharf.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

Our walk began at the Conservatory of Flowers. The predictably beautiful
weather had drawn many people out for a nice picnic, and most of the grassy
areas of the park were strewn with groups of family and friends enjoying their
weekend.

From the Conservatory we walked to the California Academy of Sciences and
rested in the large landscaped concourse between the Academy and the de Young
Museum to spend time admiring the architecture, people and music in the area.
After our short break we checked out Huntington Falls at Strawberry Hill as we
made our way through the park to Spreckels Lake.

When we arrived at the lake we were interested to find a group of men testing 
what appeared to be hand-crafted model sailboats. We watched them push their 
ships toward the middle of the lake and then run along the shore following the 
graceful and gradual voyages of their crafts. Another group of young families
were happily feeding and chasing the many birds that had gathered at the large
platform of the shore. We spent around a half hour soaking in the sun and the
scenery before moving on.

Our next stop was the Legion of Honor near the Lands End Trail. The trek was a
little over a mile with a 240-foot climb, but the views were great and we were
able to check out the memorial statues and the fountain at the terrace. We'd
walked around four miles already with a bit more planned in the Presidio, so 
we decided against following the Lands End Trail to the beach and instead 
caught an Uber out to Crissy Field. 

We were dropped off near Fort Point Beer Company, so we crossed the grassy
field and headed out to the beach for some photos of the Golden Gate Bridge. We
took a slow walk along the San Francisco Bay Trail, past the marsh toward the
east picnic area. Our final attraction of the day was the nearby Palace of Fine
Arts.

<div class="caption-img">

       alt="Classical pillars at the Palace of Fine Arts">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>The architecture at the Palace of Fine Arts was unique and impressive, 
    a bit of a novelty against the style of the city.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

We took a short walk through the dome and the surrounding grounds, admiring the
fountain and the lake. The evening was creeping in, and this was Prom season,
so we met large groups of local teenagers dressed up for dinner and photos. 
Staff appeared to be preparing the theatre for a party as well.

Our sightseeing finished for the day, we walked through the city and past Fort
Mason back to Fisherman's Wharf, stopping at Ghirardelli Square along the way
for snacks â€” we couldn't miss an opportunity for that ice cream when we'd be
passing by anyway!

We wrapped up the day by visiting the sea lions again at Pier 39 before
returning to the hotel. We'd put on quite a bit of mileage â€”Â roughly 10 miles
of walking with about 600 feet of elevation changes!

<br>
#### Day 5
After several days of adventures we were ready for a low-key day of
relaxation. We slept in and then did a bit more light exploring near our hotel.

First we walked to Lombard Street to see the world-famous winding road and
landscaping. This was definitely a hot tourist location, as there were dozens
of others walking and driving by, taking photos and climbing the pathways on
either side of the road.

Next we learned about a couple of old ships at the Hyde Street Pier, and then 
spent some time walking through MusÃ©e MÃ©canique, the unique and interesting 
home of all kinds of antique coin-operated machines and games.

We avoided the rain the rest of the day at the hotel and relaxed while planning
our next and final day in the Bay Area.

<br>
#### Day 6
Our final day was going to be a long one â€” our red-eye flight wasn't scheduled
to depart from SFO until 12:30AM on Tuesday, and Taylor had booked a tour of
the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose. After seeing so much of Fisherman's
Wharf and the surrounding area, we planned to spend this day taking a meandering
trip around the bay on our way to the airport.

We wanted to visit Battery Spencer on our way out of the city, so we woke up 
early and got out to Enterprise shortly after they opened at 8:00AM. We hoped 
to avoid the crowds at the iconic overlook of the Golden Gate Bridge, so we
were thrilled to pull into the parking area and see only a couple other
vehicles. The vista over the enormous bridge and sprawling city was truly
breathtaking.

    <p>We had saved the most spectacular view for our final day, and we were
    pretty happy tourists after a week of adventures.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->


After snapping a few photos we headed back to the rental car to start our
journey around the bay. Our first stop was for breakfast at Le Croissant, a
small diner in San Quentin. The food was excellent and the atmosphere reminded 
us of a small breakfast club back in Wisconsin. With our stomachs full we made
the drive across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, an impressively long structure
spanning the east and west edges of the San Francisco Bay.

Now on the eastern shore of the bay for the first time, we spent about an hour
exploring the free [Rosie the Riveter WWII Home 
Front](https://www.nps.gov/rori/index.htm){: .underline-effect}{: 
target="blank"}. The Visitor Education Center had many interesting exhibits
that painted a picture of life in the Bay Area during World War II,
illustrating how migration for industrial jobs played a crucial role in the
cultural development of the region after the war.

When we were finished at this National Historical Park we hopped back in the
car and followed the outline of the bay all the way down to San Jose. With some
time to kill before our tour at the Winchester Mystery House, we stopped for a
stroll through the nearby Municipal Rose Garden.

    the flowers.</p>
  </div><!-- /.caption -->
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

As our scheduled tour time approached we made the short drive to Winchester
Boulevard. I'm not an avid fan of haunted stories, but this was Taylor's
second-most anticipated attraction behind Alcatraz. The tour was interesting,
and the house itself was quite strange and mystifying. Taylor enjoyed the
experience, so it was a nice way to close out our trip.

From the Winchester House we drove up through Cupertino and Mountain View so
that we could pass the Apple and Google campuses (as an IT nerd I just wanted a
glimpse of these Silicon Valley giants). Our final destination was the rental
car drop-off at SFO, and after a short AirTrain ride we were ready to go
through security and have some dinner.

We spent a couple hours reading and watching Netflix while we waited for our 
departing red-eye. We touched down in Chicago right on time, and after a short
delay and switching planes we were back in the air on our way home to Green
Bay.

The bitter midwest weather was an unwelcome shift after a week of lovely
west coast sun, but the real treat was finding our car buried under heavy snow 
when we got to the airport parking lot. It took 45 minutes to dig our way out, 
and after a short drive home we found two more feet blanketing our entire
driveway!

<br>
#### Summary
Taylor and I had been focused on some other priorities in life, so this was our
first big vacation since our honeymoon almost three years earlier. It was also
the first time that we'd used travel-hacking strategies. The Bay Area certainly
did not disappoint as our first major vacation destination!

The weather was outstanding, especially in contrast to the long and harsh
Wisconsin spring. But more importantly, there were just so many things to do in
San Francisco. The two big attractions for us were Alcatraz (Taylor's favorite
part of the trip) and Muir Woods National Monument (my favorite), and they were
both excellent journeys that we won't forget. We did a ton of sightseeing in
our brief six days, but there was still so much more that we could have
experienced, which speaks to the sheer volume of interesting culture and
history in the area.

For two people interested in history and nature, this was a fantastic trip. 
Maybe we'll return someday!
