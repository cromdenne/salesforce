It's been an exciting couple of months for this Salesforce guy — from starting 
a new job as a consultant in April to two new certifications in a three-week 
span, spring 2021 has been a bit of a whirlwind!<!-- end_excerpt -->

Becoming a professional developer was always my long-term target, but first 
my focus was getting a job and hands-on experience in the Salesforce ecosystem 
as an Administrator.

As an IT Support swiss army knife I'd only used my software development skills
occasionally in the eight years since I graduated from UW-Madison with a 
Computer Sciences degree. I had a solid foundation in object-oriented 
programming thanks to those studies, and I had also crafted my knowledge of
front-end web development through personal and professional projects over the 
years. So while searching for Administrator roles I carried those development 
experiences with me in also preparing to take the Platform Developer I exam.

After cleaning up my LinkedIn profile in December I began getting a few 
messages from recruiters about Admin openings, but most were generic and not 
serious inquiries. Standard LinkedIn recruiter stuff, at least from my 
experience to that point.

Then in late February, as I was halfway through Platform Developer I material
and also interviewing for an attractive Administrator role, I got a different
kind of message from a recruiter.

[Jordan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jzmick){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}
was genuine — I could tell he had taken the time to research about me and 
assessed my fit for a role he was looking to fill, rather than making me the 
recipient of one of a scatter of impersonal messages to see who would bite 
(like some of the other recruiters I had interacted with).

The role wasn't for an Admin though — it was for a Salesforce Developer 
Consultant.

I was excited, but cautious — I hadn't considered this kind of role, and it 
was certainly an acceleration of my journey in the Salesforce world. I had an 
open mind though, and if this was the right fit I was ready to jump into the 
challenge.

After talking with Jordan I met with a co-founder of this small company, and 
then had to complete a small project to test my development and problem-solving
skills. The exercise involved building a Lightning Web Component to meet a 
fictional business requirement in one week.

This was what I enjoyed doing, and this was what I wanted to do every day!

The project went well and after another meeting with the lead 
Developer/Technical Architect and then the other co-founder, I landed a great
offer and agreed to join the team!

I've been working at [Aleysian](https://www.aleysian.com/){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}
for almost a month now, and I'm loving my new Salesforce career. I've got a 
ton to learn, but this transition has been exciting and exactly what I was 
looking for in moving from IT to development — plus I get to work from home!

    An aside: I'm obviously biased, but I'm being honest when I say the people 
    at Aleysian are great, and they know their stuff — if you're at a business 
    looking for Salesforce help, we would be an excellent partner for you.

In preparing for the new role I aggressively moved up my timeline for earning 
the Platform Developer I certification. In two weeks I finished the material 
in the [Prepare for Your Salesforce Platform Developer I Credential trailmix](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/users/strailhead/trailmixes/prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-developer-i-credential){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}
as well as the [Study Guide and Practice Exams at Focus on Force](https://focusonforce.com/salesforce-certifications/platform-developer-1/){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}.
I took the exam the day before I started my new job, and I passed!

My first few weeks on the job have been a mix of learning and diving into 
small projects. Using the free time I have before I become more embedded into 
consulting projects, I followed the same prepartion process for the Platform 
App Builder exam — I worked through the [Trailmix](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/users/strailhead/trailmixes/prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-app-builder-credential){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}
as well as the [Focus on Force Study Guide and Practice Exams](https://focusonforce.com/salesforce-certifications/platform-app-builder/){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}.

This week I took the exam, and I'm now 3x Salesforce Certified!

I'm now officially on the path to becoming a Salesforce Architect, and I'll be 
tackling the next two certifications on the road towards [Application Architect](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/credentials/applicationarchitect){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}.

Before I wrap up, there are a few resources I need to share that were 
extremely important on my path to becoming a Salesforce professional. I 
certainly wouldn't have this dream job if I hadn't stumbled onto each of these!

First, I learned about careers in Salesforce on a [ChooseFI podcast with 
Bradley Rice](https://www.choosefi.com/salesforce-career/){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}
in early 2019. Although I didn't start pursuing this career change until late 
2020, I wouldn't know anything about the Salesforce ecosystem without this 
exposure.

I've followed [Bradley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradforce/){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}
ever since, and in my opinion there is not another resource out there as 
valuable as what he provides for people who want a Salesforce career. Learning 
in Trailhead and getting certified are important, but what Bradley offers is a 
real *career path* for aspiring Salesforce professionals. Things like how to 
brand yourself, how to land interviews, how to impress companies and get 
offers, and where your Salesforce career can take you.

I soaked up as much information as I could from Bradley's free resources, but 
he also has some paid resources. I haven't used them, but based on what I know 
about Bradley and how valuable his free material is, I'm pretty confident that 
the paid stuff is the real deal too, espcially if you want to land a job in 
the Salesforce space quicker and more efficiently than I did.

I also want to mention [Jordan Nelson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-nelson-salesforce){:.underline-effect}{:target="blank"}.
Jordan is a Salesforce professional, but he's also an expert at LinkeIn and 
creating a personal brand. He posts frequently and shares great advice about 
building an online presence to help you stand out in your job search.

I'm not special, I just put in some real effort and got lucky being in the 
right place at the right time with my job search. I'm incredibly fortunate to 
be on the path that I'm on, and I'm excited to continute learning and see 
where this Salesforce journey will take me!
