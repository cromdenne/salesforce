Our Planet Express Salesforce org is still missing its most important 
ingredient: data! But before we enter or import any of our real data, we need 
to get rid of the preloaded data in our org.<!-- end_excerpt -->

Even though this is “dummy” data, we’re going to practice diligence and export 
records before deleting them. This will also allow us to get familiar with the 
tool we’ll be using most when we import data later, Dataloader.io. We’ll get 
started by opening setup and finding “Dataloader.io” (Integrations --> 
Dataloader.io).

    We could likely use the download version of Data Loader for the tasks 
    we’re going to complete here, but I like Dataloader.io more for a few 
    reasons:
    <ul style="list list-unstyled">
      <li>
        It’s cloud-based, so unlike Data Loader it doesn’t require a download 
        or much configuration
      </li>
      <li>
        The interface is much cleaner and easier to use
      </li>
      <li>
        It’s easier to export data with IDs in order to “connect” records that 
        have relationships
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div><!-- /.row -->
</div><!-- /.note -->

We’ll click “Launch dataloader.io” to go to the external website. Next, we’ll 
“Login with Salesforce” and fill out the appropriate information/prompts to 
get logged in. (We need to select “Production” for our org type since we’re 
using a Developer Org.)

Now that we’re logged in, let’s select New Task --> Export from the top menu.

<div class="caption-img">
    <img class="img-fluid lazy"
         src="/images/placeholder.png"
         data-src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13cUlsdqi-e7CIqkpSJ3WbssE_mRrxdc0"
         alt="Dataloader.io home screen">
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

There are two types of “dummy” data that we’ll get rid of today, since those 
are part of our data model: **Accounts** and **Contacts**. We’ll export 
Accounts first, so in the list of objects let’s select Accounts and click next.

We don’t need much information since these are just dummy accounts, so we’ll 
just select *Account ID* and *Account Name* for our fields. We want to select 
all accounts, so we won’t apply any filters. And we’ll sort our records by 
*Account Name*.


<div class="caption-img">
    <img class="img-fluid lazy"
         src="/images/placeholder.png"
         data-src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1xiiUrEFdUWVZkcgip4510x-d4mZEW8X_"
         alt="Dataloader.io export Account options">
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

When those settings are good we’ll click next. We don’t need to change any of 
the default options on the final screen, so we’ll click “Save and Run”.

We don’t have many records, so our export should finish after just a few 
seconds. We can click on the “12 successes” link to download the CSV file 
generated by our export.

<div class="caption-img">
    <img class="img-fluid lazy"
         src="/images/placeholder.png"
         data-src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Rx3XtDWcXb7BTnuAquKGtY2gjn-w-Alx"
         alt="Dataloader.io task complete">
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

A quick perusal of our CSV file confirms that all 12 records are preloaded 
“dummy” data that we want to get rid of.

Now, we could go back into Salesforce and use the “Mass Delete Records” 
feature to remove all of these Accounts. But since we’ve already got 
Dataloader.io open and we now have a file with the IDs of all the Accounts we 
want to delete, we might as well do it here!

<div class="note">
  <div class="row label">Note<span class="vertical-rule"></span></div>
  <div class="row text">
    Our exported CSV has a row for all of the Accounts in our system, and 
    we’re going to leave it that way since we want to remove all dummy data.
    But if we instead wanted to delete only a few records, we could use Excel 
    to manipulate this CSV file and include only the records we wanted to 
    delete.
  </div><!-- /.row -->
</div><!-- /.note -->

From this screen we’ll go to New Task --> Delete and then select Accounts 
again. On the next screen we’ll upload our CSV, and then we’ll confirm that 
the application selected the header for our “Account ID”.

<div class="caption-img">
    <img class="img-fluid lazy"
         src="/images/placeholder.png"
         data-src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10in812LqyQSupxfZj5fVXAbZ08ZCQiKi"
         alt="Dataloader.io object delete select ID field">
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

If everything is correct we’ll click next, and then “Save and Run” on the next 
screen.

Uh oh, we ran into some errors! It looks like DataLoader was able to delete 3 
of our 12 records, but failed on 9 of them. If we click on the “9 errors” link 
we can download the CSV and see that all of the errors were because the 
Accounts had associated **Cases**.

Since we won’t need Cases for our Planet Express org, we can go ahead and 
delete those as well. We don’t have a CSV file with all of the Case IDs, so 
although we could export one in DataLoader and then use it to delete the 
records (like we did for Accounts), let’s instead move into Salesforce and try 
out the “Mass Delete Records” tool.

Back in Salesforce, we’ll begin by finding “Mass Delete Records” (Data --> 
Mass Delete Records). We’ll select “Mass Delete Cases”, and then without 
changing any of the filters we’ll click “Search”. This should return all of 
our Case records.

<div class="caption-img">
    <img class="img-fluid lazy"
         src="/images/placeholder.png"
         data-src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1XaIc2EfGv50J7Wt-3WsQmX9g7LKdvBTa"
         alt="Salesforce mass delete cases filter results">
</div><!-- /.caption-img -->

This is what we expected, so we’ll use the checkbox next to the “Case Number” 
column header to highlight all of the Cases, and then we’ll click “Delete” at 
the bottom of the page. The page refreshes and poof, our Cases are gone!

Now that our Cases are taken care of, let’s use this same method to remove the 
rest of our Accounts and Contacts.

Back on the Mass Delete Records page, let’s select “Mass Delete Accounts”. At 
the options screen we’ll leave our filters empty, but we’ll check the boxes 
for:
- “Delete Accounts that have associated Closed/Won Opportunities.”
- “Delete Accounts that are associated with Opportunities owned by someone 
else.”

We click “Search” and we see our 9 remaining Accounts in the results list. 
Just like before we’ll click the checkbox next to the “Account Name” header to 
select all of the records, and then we’ll click “Delete”. Voila!

**Contacts** is our last set of data to remove today, but if we follow the same
pattern as with the previous two objects, we notice that there are no Contact 
records returned in our search. They must have all been attached to the 
Accounts that we deleted, which means we’re finished with our data cleanup!
